# MYDAILYWORK_CreditCard_Fraud_Detection
Building a machine learning model to identify fraudulent credit card transactions.
Preprocessing and normalize the transaction data, handle class imbalance
issues, and split the dataset into training and testing sets.
Training a classification algorithm, such as logistic regression or random
forests, to classify transactions as fraudulent or genuine.
Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like precision, recall, and
F1-score, and consider techniques like oversampling or undersampling for
improving results.
